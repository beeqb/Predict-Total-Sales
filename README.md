# Predict-Total-Sales
In many businesses, identifying which customers will make a purchase (and when), 
is a critical exercise. This is true for both brick-and-mortar outlets and online stores. 
The data provided in this challenge is website traffic data acquired from an online retailer. 
The data provides information on customer's website site visit behavior. 
Customers may visit the store multiple times, on multiple days, with or without making a purchase. 
Your goal is to predict how much sales revenue can be expected from each customer. 
The variable revenue lists the amount of money that a customer spends on a given visit.
Your goal is to predict how much money a customer will spend, in total, across all visits to the site, during the allotted one-year time frame (August 2016 to August 2017). 
More specifically, you will need to predict a transformation of the aggregrate customer-level sales value based on the natural log.
That is, if a customer has multiple revenue transactions, then you should compute the sum of all the revenue generated across all of the transactions
